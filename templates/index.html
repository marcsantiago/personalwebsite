	I graduated from Susquehanna University on May 12 of 2013. I majored in
	Biology and Philosophy and graduated with honors in biological
	research. During my time at Susquehanna University I worked as <a href="http://www.susqu.edu/facstaff/h/holt/">Dr.
	Jack Holt's</a> research assistant. I completed my senior research
	with Dr. Jack Holt on May 2013. The primary focus of the research was to
	describe the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susquehanna_River">Susquehanna
	River</a>'s upper main stem located near Byers Island. My research
	focused on the types of <b>algal communities</b> present in the Susquehanna
	River. More specifically, I worked with <b>phytoplankton</b> and
	<b>diatom-periphyton</b> to access water quality. Taxanomic groups were
	classified to species level via the use of a <b>light microscrope</b> and
	scanning <b>electron microscope</b>. My senior research focused on the
	differences and utility of using passive and active collection methods
	as suggested by the Environmental Protection Agency (<a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='documents/rapbioassess.pdf') }}">EPA</a>).
	The results of my research have been posted in the research section of
	this page.  For more information regarding systemantics within the three domains of life please <a href="http://comenius.susqu.edu/biol/202/taxa.htm">click here.</a>

	I currently teach <b>Python</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>MIT app inventor</b>, <b>MIT Scratch</b>, and <b>robotics (Arduino)</b> at Launch Math and Science Center located on 81st street and Amsterdam, I was also responsible for developing a new Java curriculum. Outside of teaching I do research at the Museum of Natural History as a volunteer in molecular systematics biologist (<b>bioinformatics</b> mostly). I am proud to say that I work closely with <a href="http://www.amnh.org/our-research/staff-directory/ward-wheeler">Dr. Ward C Wheeler</a> and <a href="http://www.amnh.org/our-research/staff-directory/prashant-sharma">Dr. Prashant Sharma</a>. We are currently in the middle of revising a paper for publication of which I am second author, likewise I am presently writing a second paper as first author for publication. Along with my lab work I have written bioinformatical <a href="https://github.com/marcsantiago/Museum-of-Natural-History">scripts</a> in Python for the museum and Prashant Sharma. Recently, in order to share my knowledge and programming skills with others, I have volunteered with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields">STEM</a> organization by the name of <a href="http://www.ladigniteglobal.org/page/landing.php">La Dignite</a> in Queens, NY. I provide them with technical advise, such as what types of laptops to buy, how to structure a programming curriculum, and developing programming exams for new hires.

	I pride myself in being able to get the job done. If I do not have the answer or know how to do something, I make it my priority to figure it out and get the job done. Although I primarily program in Python and Java I do have <b>experience programming in:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>C++ (with and without QT)</li>
		<li>C# (Form Applications)</li>
		<li>Flask (what this webpage was written in)</li>
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
	</ul>

</p>
<p>
	Having studied Philosophy I am well read and have the capacity to approach problems from many angles. As such, I love problem solving and I am well organized. I am also experienced with all major <b>operating systems:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Linux</li>
		<li>Mac OSX</li>
		<li>Windows (XP, Vista, 7, and 8)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	I am also familiar with:
	<ul>
		<li>Terminal/Shell</li>
		<li>Command Prompt/Batch</li>
	</ul>
