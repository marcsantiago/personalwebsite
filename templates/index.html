    I graduated from Susquehanna University on May 12 of 2013. I majored in
    Biology and Philosophy and graduated with honors in biological
    research. During my time at Susquehanna University I worked as <a href="http://www.susqu.edu/facstaff/h/holt/">Dr.
    Jack Holt's</a> research assistant. I completed my senior research
    with Dr. Jack Holt on May 2013. The primary focus of the research was to
    describe the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susquehanna_River">Susquehanna
    River</a>'s upper main stem located near Byers Island. My research
    focused on the types of <b>algal communities</b> present in the Susquehanna
    River. More specifically, I worked with <b>phytoplankton</b> and
    <b>diatom-periphyton</b> to access water quality. Taxanomic groups were
    classified to species level via the use of a <b>light microscrope</b> and
    scanning <b>electron microscope</b>. My senior research focused on the
    differences and utility of using passive and active collection methods
    as suggested by the Environmental Protection Agency (<a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='documents/rapbioassess.pdf') }}">EPA</a>).
    The results of my research have been posted in the research section of
    this page.  For more information regarding systemantics within the three domains of life please <a href="http://comenius.susqu.edu/biol/202/taxa.htm">click here.</a>

    I taught <b>Python</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>MIT app inventor</b>, <b>MIT Scratch</b>, and <b>robotics (Arduino)</b> at Launch Math and Science Center located on 81st street and Amsterdam, I was also responsible for developing a new Java curriculum. Outside of teaching I did research at the Museum of Natural History as a volunteer in molecular systematics biologist (<b>bioinformatics</b> mostly). I am proud to say that I worked closely with <a href="http://www.amnh.org/our-research/staff-directory/ward-wheeler">Dr. Ward C Wheeler</a> and <a href="http://www.amnh.org/our-research/staff-directory/prashant-sharma">Dr. Prashant Sharma</a>. We are currently just published a paper in the journal of Evolution and development of which I am second author, likewise I am presently writing a second paper as first author for publication. Along with my lab work I have written bioinformatical <a href="https://github.com/marcsantiago/Museum-of-Natural-History">scripts</a> in Python for Prashant Sharma. I also volunteer my programming skills to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields">STEM</a> organization by the name of <a href="http://www.ladigniteglobal.org/page/landing.php">La Dignite</a> in Queens, NY. I provide them with technical advise, such as what types of laptops to buy, how to structure a programming curriculum, and developing programming exams for new hires.
      That being said I currently work at <a href="http://pubgears.com">pubgears</a> as a software engineer.

    Having studied Philosophy I am well read and have the capacity to approach problems from many angles. As such, I love problem solving and I am well organized. I am also experienced with all major <b>operating systems:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Linux</li>
      <li>Mac OSX</li>
      <li>Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10)</li>
